// 1: Setting up a C++ Development Environment

	//IDEs
	// Integrated Development Environments - tools we use to build software (eg. Visual Studio, CLion, Rider)

	//to create a new project:
	//- in Visual Studio, creating an Empty Project from the Create a new project window (this window should be accessible from your start screen)
	//- or File > New > Project from the top menu bar

	//to add C++ file to our project:
	//- in Visual Studio, we can add a file from the top menu bar under Project > Add New Item

	//in Visual Studio, for example, we can use the Start Without Debugging button on the top menu to build and run the program
	//our program should open a terminal where we see the output of the code - a simple "Hello World!" message
	
	std::cout << "Hello World!";
	
	// cout - is an abbreviation of "character output"
	//we stream things to the character output using << operator, with cout on the left and the thing we want to send on the right
	//if the thing we want to send is some text, we need to put the text in double quotes
	//we must be specifically using the " character, commonly called "straight double quotes"
	//- this is either near the right-shift key or above the 2 on the top row
	//finally, we need to end our statement using a semi-colon ;
	

	// Compiling or Building the Program - converting our code into a program that can be executed on a computer
	// Compiler - the software that converts our code to an executable program

	// Operator - is a symbol that performs some action on one or more objects in our program
	//in the previous example, the objects it is acting upon are: cout and "Hello World"
	// Operands - the objects an operator acts upon

	// Statement is an instruction - some action we are commanding the computer to carry out
	// Semicolon - ; - is used to denote the end of each statement

	//we can stream as many things to the output as we want simply by repeating the pattern on additional lines:

	std::cout << "Hello World!";
	std::cout << "My name is Cog";
	std::cout << "Goodbye";

	//even though our previous code was spanned across multiple lines, we can see that our output wasn't, C++ is fairly flexible about the spacing around our code
	//- to insert a line break into our output, we stream the special sequence "\n" (we need \, not / )

	std::cout << "Hello World!";
	std::cout << "\n";
	std::cout << "My name is Cog";
	std::cout << "\n";
	std::cout << "Goodbye";

	//we can also place the \n character within an existing string of text - even in the middle of a string of text

	std::cout << "Hello World!\n";
	std::cout << "My name is Cog\nGoodbye";

	// streaming endl or std::endl to the output - another way of achieving line breaks
	//however, the option of inserting the new line sequence in the middle of our text is not available when using endl or std::endl
	//those need to be streamed independently of any other content

	std::cout << "Hello World!";
	std::cout << std::endl;
	std::cout << "My name is Cog" << std::endl;
	std::cout << "Goodbye" << "\n";

	// Chaining the Operator - stream multiple things to the terminal in a single statement, by using the << operator multiple times
	//we can further shorten this program to a single statement
	//we can tell when our statement ends by looking at where the semicolon is

	std::cout << "Hello World!\n"
		<< "My name is Cog\n"
		<< "Goodbye";

	// Outputting Numbers
	//we can output many different types of data
	//note, we don't need to surround numbers with quotes

	std::cout << 14 << " is a number\n"
		<< "Another number is " << 41;

	return 0;
